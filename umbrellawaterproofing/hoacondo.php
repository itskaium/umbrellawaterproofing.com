                            <p class="p-font"><strong>&zwj;</strong>If you notice any of the Signs of Water Damage within a residential unit or along common areas like walkways, roofs, walkways and decks, time is of the essence to find the problem and get it fixed. As waters build within walls or underneath concrete slabs, the structural integrity of your building might be compromised.<br><br>Umbrella Site Inspectors are waterproofing forensics experts. We can inspect for damage, pinpoint causes and work with insurance companies and our specialized contractors to expedite the repairs. For construction less than five years old, the builder might still be liable for improper construction or code violations. Waterproofing is an all too frequent shortcut that builders make to bring projects in on time and budget. This minor oversight can cause major complications down the road.</p>
