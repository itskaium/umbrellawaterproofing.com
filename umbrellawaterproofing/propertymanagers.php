                                There are some calls you’re probably used to handling: leaky faucet, clogged toilet,
                                locked door…Then there are tenant calls that should raise the caution flag: black spots
                                forming on the ceiling, soft/damp drywall, a water drip that can’t be identified. These
                                are common signs that water is leaking within your building. Leaky pipes aren’t always
                                to blame — often the roof, deck, walkway or plaza needs to be repaired, resurfaced and
                                resealed to ensure proper rainwater runoff. <br><br>

                                One call is all it takes to save your clients from the surprise costs of easily
                                preventable water-damage repairs. Umbrella Waterproofing can perform annual inspections
                                in between regularly scheduled professional waterproofing services.<br><br>

                                Flat roofs, plazas and decks made of concrete, vinyl, non-slotted wood or other
                                substrates should be professionally waterproofed (about every five years) to prevent
                                leaks and structural corrosion.
